1.- RTFM and LMGTFY usage
I last used RTFM (Read The F***ing Manual) and LMGTFY (Let Me Google That For You) while setting up a virtual environment for a Python project on my Windows 10 operating system. I needed to refer to the official documentation of virtualenv and also searched for solutions on StackOverflow.

2.- Automation using CI
A Continuous Integration (CI) system automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software changes. It helps to catch errors early and ensures that the code is working as expected.

Pseudocode for a simple CI pipeline:
```
on push to master branch:
    - pull code changes
    - run linter to check code style
    - run unit tests
    - build the code
    - deploy the code to production server
```

Here, on every push to the master branch, the pipeline will be triggered, and the steps in the pipeline will be executed in the order specified. If any step fails, the pipeline will stop and report the error.

4.-Finding matching pairs

Assumption: The input list is sorted in ascending order.

To find a matching pair that adds up to a given sum, we can use the two-pointer technique. We can have two pointers - one pointing to the start of the list and the other pointing to the end of the list. We check the sum of the values pointed by the two pointers. If the sum is greater than the given sum, we move the end pointer one position to the left. If the sum is smaller than the given sum, we move the start pointer one position to the right. If the sum is equal to the given sum, we have found a matching pair.

Code:

``` python
def find_matching_pair(arr, target_sum):
    n = len(arr)
    i, j = 0, n-1
    while i < j:
        s = arr[i] + arr[j]
        if s == target_sum:
            return (arr[i], arr[j])
        elif s < target_sum:
            i += 1
        else:
            j -= 1
    return None
```

5.-Decoding the message

The given message seems to be encoded in hexadecimal. We can decode it using Python's bytes.fromhex() method. The decoded message is in Spanish language.

Code:
```python
def decode_message_hex(message):
    decoded = bytes.fromhex(message).decode("windows-1252").strip()
    return decoded


message = "4573746520657320656c20fa6c74696d6f207061736f2c20706f72206661766f722c206167726567616d6520616c2068616e676f75743a200d0a0d0a226d617274696e406d656e646f7a6164656c736f6c61722e636f6d22207061726120736162657220717565206c6c656761737465206120657374612070617274652e0d0a0d0a477261636961732c20792065737065726f20766572746520706f7220617175ed212e"
